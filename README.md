### Berserk Mode:
The purpose of this feature is to encourage your to have a continuous flow of writing. Berserk mode allows you to set a word target and a timer for how long you have to write targeted amount of words.  The cool thing about this mode is that if you stop typing, it will start erasing your words! The buffer time before it's starts erasing is set to 2 seconds. So go berserk and don't stop writing!
